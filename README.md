# radianClock
This p5 JS sketch is a fully functioning abnormal clock. The purple and pink dots are the hours and minutes of the current time. Every second, a cirlce (made up of points) is drawn around the minute dot. The display in the center shows the hours, minutes and seconds of the current time represented by the radian measures found on a conventional unit circle.
